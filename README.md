# LIS-545-Final-Term-Project

## Data Files

These are four XLSX files contain the dataset for the project "“Humpback whale adult females and calves balance acoustic contact with vocal crypsis during periods of increased separation."

- ActiveSpace: This spreadsheet was used to determine the communication active space of adult female-calf vocal signals and whether these pairs modified this active space in response to their behavioral state.
- BehaviorModels: This spreadsheet contains two tabs. The CallRate tab was used to determine if call rate (calls per hour) varied per individual between behavioral states. In this tab, there are seven total columns. The RLMum tab was used to determine if adult females modified their received call levels (dB re 1 µPa) in response to the behavioral state of the pair. 
- DepthData: This spreadsheet was used to examine whether fine-scale dive parameters of the adult females were significantly different between behavioral states. 
- MovementData: This spreadsheet was used for the non-hierarchical partitioning clustering method ‘k-means’ to determine behavioral states.

## Metadata Files

These are four XML metadata files for the XLSX data files. They are structured according to the Darwin Core standard. More information about the Darwin Core standard can be found here: https://dwc.tdwg.org/.
